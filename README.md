# Dayplanner Project

Welcome to my Dayplanner! Here you can save your work events/schedule for the day/upcoming day. Simply click on a timeslot, and type whatever needs to go onto your schedule! Hit save and you're good to go! 


## Lessons Learned

This lesson was great for learning about parsing, moment.js, and saving items to local storage. I also utilized JQuery, which is THE BEST. It's clean, it's easy, I can't wait to learn more of it. I'm also enjoying learning more and more about javascript. It's a fun language to learn!

As always, I'd like to thank my wife! She let's me sit for hours in front of my computer learning these new skills. She's really the best.
